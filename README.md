Collision Sound aims to be an easy and powerful way of adding sound to
object collisions in [Unity](https://unity.com/).

# Getting started
Collision Sound requires the use of [Fmod Studio](https://www.fmod.com/studio)
to setup the material interactions and its parameters, so
[being familiar with it](https://www.fmod.com/learn) is strongly encouraged.

## Prerequisites
- [Fmod Studio](https://www.fmod.com/studio)
- [Unity](https://unity.com/)

## Installing
Before continuing, you should already have Unity and Fmod Studio installed.

- Download the [latest Unity package](https://github.com/Sag-Dev/physical-sound/releases)
- Import the package into your Unity project, it should now be ready
- Open the FMOD Studio project under your Unity project 'Assets/Packages/CollisionSound/fmod_project'
- Keep reading to learn how to configure your collision events.

# How to use
This guide will be divided into two separate steps: the sound events configuration
in FMOD Studio & the GameObjects setup in Unity.
